# GUI-for-singular-value-decomposition
This GUI can be used for tutorial purpose for demonstrating singular value decomposition on a 2by2 matrix. Users can input any 2by2 matrix 'A' and the direction of the 2by1 vector 'x'. The interface will then output the result of the vector 'Ax'. For a certain matrix 'A', choosing vector 'x' of different directions will result in different length of the vector 'Ax'. To get the maximum length of vector 'Ax', the direction of the input vector 'x' should be aligned with the first right singular vector of the matrix 'A'. On the contrary, if the input vector 'x' is in the direction of the the second right singular vector of the matrix 'A', then you will get minimum length of the vector 'Ax'.
